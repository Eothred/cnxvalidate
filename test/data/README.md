DISCLAIMER
=================

The files in this directory are *ONLY*, I repeat *ONLY*, for testing cnxvalidate.
The files in here do not necessarily adhere to NeXus conventions or are
usable NXDL files for any other context then cnxvalidate testing.

# Python files

The .py files in this directory are h5py programs which generate the hdf-5
files needed for testing. Rather then introducing another dependency on
h5py into the source I decided to distribute both, the .py and the h5 files.
Thus only maintainers need h5py.
