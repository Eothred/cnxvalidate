	<doc>
		Use ``NXtransformations`` to gather together any set of movable or fixed
		elements positioning the device described by the class that contains this.

		NXtransformations and depends_on fields in other classes are used to encode
		the transformations necessary to position the element which contains the
		NXtransformations group.

		The groups required content is depends_on field which contains the name of the
		first field of the transformation chain.

		Each field particiapting in the transformation chain must have the following
		attributes:

		* offset: A three float vector attribute which specifies a translation to
		  apply before performing the actual operation of the field
		* transformation_type: A text attribute which can the value of either
		  translation or rottaion. This specifies the type of operation encoded.
		* vector: A  three float attribute which describes the axis along which
		  we translate or around which we rotate
		* depends_on: A text attribute pointing to the next field in the
		  transformation hierarchy.

		For field specifications in depends_on, both the field and attribute, the
		following things are allowed:

		* . A point terminates the transformation chain
		* An absolute path in the HDF-5 file
		* A relative path deeper into the NeXus hierarchy
		* A field in the same group.

		Depends_on chains must be terminated with a period.

		The value of the translation or rotation is the value of the field.
